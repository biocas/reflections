When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share my projects with others or when I have other people working in the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you may not want all of the commits being pulled to the remote.
For instance, if you're working on a new feature you may just want to pull changes when the feature is all set up and working.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A branch is a different "direction" added to the linear history of your commits, that is useful for working on new features of your projects.
Cloning means downloading a repository which is on GitHub into your own computer.
Forking means "cloning" a repository, but directly in GitHub, without cloning the code into your computer.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
That way you can update the local copy of the remote if it has new changes, and then merge those changes 
with the ones you've made in your local branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without using GitHub I would have to keep sending and getting zip files with the multiple changes 
on projects. It would be much harder and time consuming to finish changes. Altough there is a learning
curve in using GitHub, it does make things easier.
